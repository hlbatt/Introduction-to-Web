                <h3>Things to consider when baking gluten-free</h3>
                <p style="font-weight: bold;">Gluten free bakes fall down on:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Structure. Without gluten to hold it together, many bakes are more crumbly and brittle.</li>
                    <li>Moistness. A lot of gluten free bakes can come out dry, as gluten free flours lose more moisture when baking.</li>
                </ul>
